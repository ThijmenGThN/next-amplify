# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Development Commands

### Core Commands
- `npm run lint` - Run ESLint with Next.js TypeScript rules

### Database & Types
- `npm run generate:types` - Generate TypeScript types from Payload CMS schema
- `npm run generate:importmap` - Generate import map for Payload

## Architecture Overview

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router and standalone output
- **CMS**: Payload CMS 3.x with PostgreSQL adapter
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS v4 with Shadcn/UI, Radix UI components
- **Email**: React Email with Nodemailer
- **Payments**: Stripe and Cryptomus integration
- **Internationalization**: next-intl (English/Dutch)

```

### Key Collections
The CMS manages these core collections:
- **Users**: Authentication with role-based access (admin/user)
- **Products**: Billing products (one-time/subscription)
- **Subscriptions**: User subscription management
- **Purchases**: One-time purchase tracking
- **Coupons**: Discount code system
- **CryptomusPayments**: Crypto payment tracking
- **RenewalReminders**: Subscription renewal system

### Payment Integration
- **Stripe**: Traditional payment processing with webhooks
- **Cryptomus**: Cryptocurrency payment processing
- Both systems integrate with the same user/product/subscription model

### Type Safety
- Auto-generated types from Payload schema at `src/types/payload-types.ts`
- TypeScript paths configured for `@/*` imports
